# Overview:
A basic Spring Web MVC project for searching/offering job positions with two different account possibilities - "User" and "Company".

Before running the application create a PostgreSQL database with the name "findwork.com" 
and run the AuthenticationControllerTest followed by JobOfferControllerTest to fill up the database with test data. Then login from localhost:8080.
The autogenerated accounts have usernames TestUser"x"@gmail.com and TestCompany"x"@gmail.com where "x" is a number from 1 to 7. The passwords are "12345678".
